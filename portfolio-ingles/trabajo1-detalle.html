            <p class="detalle-descripcion">
                This graphic design project was developed as part of a cultural outreach campaign focused on promoting classic literary works. The main objective was to create a visual identity that captured the timeless essence of literature by blending classical elegance with a modern visual presentation. Refined typography, a muted color palette, and balanced compositions were used to encourage engagement and reading. The design aims to connect with a contemporary audience while honoring the cultural tradition represented by the selected work.

                <h2>Phase 1: Concept Development</h2>
                <p>
                    In this stage, the key visual values for the project were defined, drawing inspiration from traditional editorial design. The goal was to convey a sense of timeless elegance and clarity. Serif typefaces were carefully selected to evoke a classic, refined aesthetic, while the color palette was kept intentionally sober, using strong contrasts to ensure visual impact and readability. These decisions laid the foundation for a visual identity that balances heritage and modernity, supporting the campaign’s cultural and communicative objectives.

                <h2>Phase 2: Layout Design</h2>
                <p>
                    During this phase, strict grid systems were implemented to ensure consistency across all visual pieces. The layout focused on establishing clear typographic hierarchies that would guide the viewer’s eye through the content in an intuitive way. Special attention was given to the alignment, spacing, and proportion of elements in order to create a harmonious and visually engaging rhythm throughout the entire project.

                <p>
                    In this final stage, all the elements came together to form a cohesive and polished visual identity. The project was carefully curated and prepared for presentation, ensuring that each piece reflected the conceptual and aesthetic intentions defined from the beginning. Mockups and visual supports were used to showcase how the identity would function in real-world contexts, emphasizing both its versatility and elegance. The final result aimed to communicate cultural value through a refined and contemporary graphic language.
